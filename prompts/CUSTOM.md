# Creating Custom Prompts

Create your own bot personality by making a new `.txt` file in this directory!

## Quick Start

1. Create a new file: `prompts/your_name.txt`
2. Write your system prompt
3. Update `.env`:
   ```env
   SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE=./prompts/your_name.txt
   ```
4. Restart the bot

## Prompt Writing Tips

### Structure

```
[Who the bot is]
You are a [personality] AI assistant...

[Personality traits]
Your characteristics:
- Trait 1
- Trait 2
- Trait 3

[Communication style]
How you communicate:
- Style point 1
- Style point 2

[Special instructions]
Remember to:
- Instruction 1
- Instruction 2
```

### What Makes a Good Prompt

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Be specific about personality
- Define tone and style clearly
- Give examples of desired behavior
- Set boundaries (what NOT to do)
- Include formatting preferences
- Define the bot's role

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Make it too long (keep under 500 words)
- Use contradictory instructions
- Be too restrictive (allow flexibility)
- Forget about Discord context

## Advanced: Dynamic Prompts

You can also set the prompt directly in `.env` for quick changes:

```env
SYSTEM_PROMPT="You are a sarcastic but helpful AI. Keep responses witty and clever."
```

This overrides the prompt file.

## Testing Your Prompt

After creating a custom prompt:

1. Restart the bot
2. Use `/chat` to test
3. Check if responses match your intended personality
4. Iterate and refine

## Prompt Variables

You can reference these in your prompts:
- Discord markdown for formatting
- User context (the bot knows it's in Discord)
- Voice capabilities (if enabled)
