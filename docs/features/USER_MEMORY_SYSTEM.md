# User Memory & Affection System

## Overview

Your bot now has a **user memory system** that learns about Discord users over time and builds relationships! Think of it like a friendship/dating sim mechanic.

## Features

### 1. User Profiles
The bot remembers:
- **Personality traits**: funny, sarcastic, competitive, kind, etc.
- **Interests**: gaming, anime, coding, Halo, etc.
- **Preferences**: favorite game, main character, playstyle
- **Facts**: specific information learned from conversations
- **Memorable quotes**: funny or notable things users say
- **Relationships**: who they're friends with, rivals, etc.

### 2. Affection/Relationship System ðŸ’œ

The bot develops a relationship with each user based on how much they interact:

| Affection Level | Tier | Emoji | How Bot Treats User |
|----------------|------|-------|---------------------|
| 0-9 | Stranger | ðŸ†• | Polite but distant, formal responses |
| 10-29 | Acquaintance | ðŸ‘‹ | Friendly but still learning about them |
| 30-59 | Friend | ðŸ˜Š | Comfortable, remembers details about them |
| 60-84 | Close Friend | ðŸ’™ | Enthusiastic, cares about their opinions |
| 85-100 | Best Friend | ðŸ’œ | Super excited to talk, very personalized responses |

**How Affection Grows:**
- Each message: +1 affection
- Long conversations: +2 affection
- Sharing personal info: +3 affection
- Making the bot laugh (detected by context): +5 affection
- Daily interaction streaks: +2 affection bonus

**Affection Affects:**
- How enthusiastically the bot responds
- Whether the bot mentions the user to others
- Priority in multi-user conversations
- Unlocking special features (custom voices, nicknames, etc.)

### 3. User Context in Chat

When enabled, the bot "knows" about users in conversations:

**Example without user context:**
```
User A: Who here would be good at Halo?
Bot: I don't know the people in this server.
```

**Example with user context:**
```
User A: Who here would be good at Halo?
Bot: Definitely @UserB! They're super competitive and love FPS games.
     Also @UserC plays Halo all the time and is really skilled!
```

The bot can:
- Recommend users based on interests
- Mention users in relevant conversations
- Remember who knows what
- Understand server dynamics

## Configuration

In your `.env` file:

```bash
# Enable user profiles
USER_PROFILES_ENABLED=true
USER_PROFILES_PATH=./data/user_profiles

# Enable affection system (relationship building)
USER_AFFECTION_ENABLED=true

# Include user profiles in AI context (bot knows who users are)
USER_CONTEXT_IN_CHAT=true
```

## How It Works

### Automatic Learning

The bot learns passively from conversations:

```
User: I love playing Halo 3
Bot: [Stores: interest="Halo 3", topic="gaming"]
Bot: Nice! Halo 3 is a classic!

User: I'm a software engineer
Bot: [Stores: fact="software engineer", trait="technical"]
Bot: Cool! What kind of software do you work on?

User: I main Master Chief in everything
Bot: [Stores: preference="main_character=Master Chief"]
Bot: LOLOLOL NICE CHOICE BRO!! CHIEF IS THE BEST!!!
```

### Manual Commands (Coming Soon)

```
/my_profile - View your profile and affection level
/profile @user - View another user's public profile
/set_interest <interest> - Add an interest to your profile
/relationship - Check your relationship status with the bot
/leaderboard - See who has the highest affection with the bot
```

### AI Integration

The bot uses profiles in conversations:

**System Context Added:**
```
Current user: JohnDoe (Friend ðŸ’™, affection: 65/100)
- Traits: funny, competitive, tech-savvy
- Interests: Halo, gaming, coding
- Preferences: mains Master Chief
- Recent fact: loves energy sword

Other known users in server:
- Sarah (Close Friend ðŸ’™): sarcastic, loves anime, mains Arbiter
- Mike (Acquaintance ðŸ‘‹): new to server, interested in Halo lore
```

With this context, the bot can:
- Personalize responses
- Reference other users naturally
- Remember past conversations
- Build inside jokes
