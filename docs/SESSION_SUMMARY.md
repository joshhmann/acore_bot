# Session Summary - Complete Bot Enhancement

## What We Built

This session transformed your basic Discord bot into an **advanced AI companion** with roleplay, memory, and real-time knowledge!

---

## Major Features Added

### 1. L3-8B-Stheno Roleplay Model Support ✅
**Files**: [services/ollama.py](services/ollama.py), [config.py](config.py), [.env.example](.env.example)

Added advanced sampling parameters for roleplay:
- Temperature: 1.17 (creative responses)
- Min-P: 0.075 (quality control)
- Top-K: 50 (vocabulary diversity)
- Repeat Penalty: 1.1 (reduces repetition)

**Benefit**: Much better character consistency and natural dialogue!

**Docs**: [STHENO_SETUP.md](STHENO_SETUP.md)

---

### 2. Character System Prompts ✅
**Files**: [prompts/chief.txt](prompts/chief.txt), [prompts/arbiter.txt](prompts/arbiter.txt)

Created detailed character prompts using roleplay format:
- **Master Chief**: ALL CAPS, 1337 speak, chaotic gamer rage
- **The Arbiter**: British sophistication, dry wit, exasperated intelligence

Both follow the "expert actor" format for immersive roleplay.

**Usage**:
```bash
/set_persona chief    # Switch to Master Chief
/set_persona arbiter  # Switch to Arbiter
```

---

### 3. Persona Switching Commands ✅
**File**: [cogs/chat.py](cogs/chat.py:309-435)

New commands for dynamic character switching:
- `/set_persona <name>` - Switch bot personality instantly
- `/list_personas` - See all available characters with previews

**Benefit**: Users can choose which character they want to talk to without restarting!

**Docs**: [PERSONA_SWITCHING.md](PERSONA_SWITCHING.md)

---

### 4. TTS Text Cleaning ✅
**Files**: [utils/helpers.py](utils/helpers.py:176-244), [services/tts.py](services/tts.py:88-95)

Added automatic cleaning to remove roleplay formatting from voice:
- Removes: `*actions*`, emojis, markdown, URLs
- Keeps: Natural dialogue, punctuation for emphasis
- Result: No more "asterisk sighs asterisk" in voice!

**Example**:
```
Text: *sighs* Good grief, Chief. 😤
Voice says: "Good grief, Chief."
```

**Docs**: [TTS_CLEANING.md](TTS_CLEANING.md)

---

### 5. User Profile & Memory System ✅
**File**: [services/user_profiles.py](services/user_profiles.py)

Bot now learns about each user:
- **Personality traits**: funny, sarcastic, competitive
- **Interests**: gaming, Halo, anime, coding
- **Preferences**: favorite game, main character
- **Facts**: specific information from conversations
- **Quotes**: memorable things users say
- **Relationships**: friendships with other users

Stored in: `data/user_profiles/user_{id}.json`

**Docs**: [USER_MEMORY_SYSTEM.md](USER_MEMORY_SYSTEM.md)

---

### 6. Affection/Relationship System ✅
**File**: [services/user_profiles.py](services/user_profiles.py:369-413) (enhancement)

Bot builds relationships based on interaction:

| Level | Tier | Emoji | Behavior |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 0-9 | Stranger | 🆕 | Polite, formal |
| 10-29 | Acquaintance | 👋 | Friendly, learning |
| 30-59 | Friend | 😊 | Comfortable, remembers details |
| 60-84 | Close Friend | 💙 | Enthusiastic, caring |
| 85-100 | Best Friend | 💜 | Super excited, very personal |

**Benefit**: Makes bot feel alive - relationships grow over time!

**Example**:
```
Day 1:  YO WHATS UP?? 🆕
Week 2: DUDE HEY!! GOOD TO SEE U!! 😊
Month 1: YOOO MY BRO!!! I MISSED U!! 💜
```

---

### 7. Web Search Integration ✅
**File**: [services/web_search.py](services/web_search.py)

Bot can search the internet for real-time info:
- **DuckDuckGo**: Free, privacy-friendly (default)
- **Google**: Better results (requires API key)
- **Auto-detection**: Searches when query needs current info

**Example**:
```
User: Who won Halo World Championship 2024?
Bot: [Searches web automatically]
Bot: DUDE IT WAS OPTIC GAMING!! THEY DESTROYED EVERYONE BRO!!
```

**Docs**: [WEB_SEARCH.md](WEB_SEARCH.md)

## How Everything Works Together

### Example Conversation Flow

```
1. User sends message → Bot loads their profile
2. Profile shows: Friend tier (😊), interests: Halo, personality: competitive
3. User asks: "Who won the latest Halo tournament?"
4. Bot detects: Needs web search (keyword: "latest")
5. Bot searches: DuckDuckGo for "Halo tournament winner 2024"
6. Bot gets results: "OpTic Gaming wins..."
7. Bot generates response using:
   - Stheno model (creative roleplay)
   - Chief persona (ALL CAPS, gamer speak)
   - User profile (knows they love competitive Halo)
   - Search results (OpTic Gaming won)
   - Affection level (Friend = enthusiastic)
8. Bot responds: "YO DUDE!!! OPTIC GAMING WON TEH CHAMPIONSHIP!! THEY CRUSHED IT BRO!! U GOTTA WATCH TEH VODS!! 😊"
9. Bot cleans text for TTS: "YO DUDE OPTIC GAMING WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP THEY CRUSHED IT BRO"
10. Bot speaks in voice channel (Kokoro am_onyx voice)
11. Bot updates user profile: +1 affection, +1 interaction count
```
