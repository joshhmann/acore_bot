# Task B1: Update PERSONA_SCHEMA.md with All Phase 1-2 Features

## Task Description

The PERSONA_SCHEMA.md documentation needs to be updated to include all the Phase 1-2 features that have been implemented (19/30 features). Currently it documents some features but may be missing others or have outdated information.

- ✅ T5-T6: Persona Memory Isolation
- ✅ T7-T8: Curiosity-Driven Follow-Up Questions
- ✅ T9-T10: Topic Interest Filtering
- ✅ T11-T12: Adaptive Ambient Timing
- ✅ T19-T20: Dynamic Framework Blending
- ✅ T21-T22: Emotional Contagion System

**Phase 2: Adaptive Behavior (8/8 complete)**:
- ✅ T13-T14: Character Evolution System
- ✅ T15-T16: Persona Conflict System
- ✅ T17-T18: Activity-Based Persona Switching
- ✅ T25-T26: Semantic Lorebook Triggering
- ✅ T23-T24: Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
